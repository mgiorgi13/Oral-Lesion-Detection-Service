# Oral-Lesion-Detection-Service

This project is an innovative information system for managing business processes, specifically designed to diagnose oral tumors and lesions in a company. However, the techniques used in this project can also be applied to smaller projects and different industries.

The system includes:

* Identification of main activities for process development
* Construction of a BPMN model
* AS-IS and TO-BE model structuring
* Use of BIMP to extract logs
* Use of DISCO for process mining
* Use of PROM and APROMORE for in-depth data analysis.

The complete documentation of the project is shared, with the hope that it will inspire future projects. This is just a brief summary of the work, but there are many other interesting details included in the project documentation.
